"""Reproduction case for the SQLite WAL-mode-switch race documented in
NOTES.md (2026-07-08, reproeval/cache.py).

Multiple connections racing to perform the *first* switch of a brand-new
SQLite file from its default rollback journal to WAL mode can hit
sqlite3.OperationalError("database is locked") even with busy_timeout set
*before* the journal_mode pragma. busy_timeout governs ordinary read/write
lock contention; it does not reliably cover this one-time mode-switch, which
briefly requires an exclusive lock to rewrite the database header. This
script reproduces that directly with plain sqlite3 and multiprocessing --
no Ray, no aiosqlite, no asyncio -- to isolate the mechanism from anything
Ray- or reproeval-specific.

The actual fix in reproeval lives in ResponseCache.connect()'s bounded retry
(tests/test_cache.py mocks that retry path directly, since the race itself
isn't deterministically reproducible on every run -- typically once every
handful of trials on ordinary hardware, as this script demonstrates).

Usage: python scripts/repro_sqlite_wal_race.py [n_workers] [n_trials]
