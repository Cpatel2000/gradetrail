"""Build examples/data/gsm8k_500.jsonl from the GSM8K test split.

Requires the `datasets` library (pip install datasets) -- script-only, NOT an
evalflow dependency, deliberately not added to pyproject.toml. This script is
run once to regenerate the file; evalflow itself never imports `datasets`.

Each row gets an `answer_pattern` field alongside `answer`: the same number
with optional commas at thousands boundaries (e.g. "114200" -> "114,?200",
matching either "114200" or "114,200"). 52/500 answers in this slice are >=4
digits, where a model could plausibly write either form -- see NOTES.md and
examples/gsm8k_500.yaml, which uses answer_pattern (not answer) in its regex.
