"""Tests for evalflow.scorers.judge: judge-file loading and the LLM-as-judge scorer.

Mocks only the Provider boundary (a fake .complete()), with hand-built raw
reply strings covering malformed JSON, JSON wrapped in markdown fences, and
valid replies. Never calls a real API. Per design doc rule 5, a judge that
never produces parseable JSON (even after the one nudge retry) must return
state="judge_error" — never a silent score of 0.
