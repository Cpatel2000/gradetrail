    total_cost_usd is strict: if either the primary model or (when present)
    the judge model has no PRICING entry, the whole total is None rather than
    silently summing only the priced side -- same loud-failure-over-silent-
    undercount precedent as ResponseCache.put()'s JSON-serializability check.

    Judge cost is billed per sample regardless of r.cached: `cached` reflects
    only the primary response's cache status, and judge calls are never
    cached (see NOTES.md), so a fully-cached primary run with a judge scorer
    still has real, nonzero cost from the judge calls alone.

    aborted_reason is a pure pass-through onto RunSummary: the runner (not
    this function) detects an early-abort and already knows the shared
    failure detail, so there is nothing for summarize() itself to compute.
