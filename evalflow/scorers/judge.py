"""LLM-as-judge scorer.

Loads and validates the versioned judge YAML, renders it with sample fields
plus the response, calls a Provider, and parses the JSON reply. A malformed
reply is retried exactly once with a "reply with only JSON" nudge appended to
the same prompt; if that also fails to parse, the result is state=judge_error
— never a silent 0 (design doc rule 5).
