"""RayRunner: single-machine Ray backend for LocalRunner-equivalent execution.

Samples are sharded into n_workers contiguous batches; one Ray task per batch
reconstructs its own Provider(s) and its own ResponseCache connection to the
shared cache path (WAL handles the contention -- see cache.py's two-connection
test), then runs the exact same per-sample pipeline as LocalRunner
(runner.local.run_one_sample). A whole-batch failure (the worker died, its
task raised) converts every sample in that batch to a provider_error result
with the failure in detail -- the run itself never crashes, the same
guarantee LocalRunner gives at the per-sample level.

ray is imported lazily, only inside run() -- the base reproeval install never
requires it; `pip install reproeval[ray]` is required to actually use this
backend.
